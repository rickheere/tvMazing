# TvMazing.

## Background

For a new metadata ingester we need a service that provides the cast of all the tv shows in the TVMaze database, so we can enrich our metadata system with this information. The TVMaze database provides a public RESTAPI that you can query for this data.

## Install

This project uses [node](http://nodejs.org) and [npm](https://npmjs.com). Go check them out if you don't have them locally installed.

```sh
$ yarn
$ yarn bootstrap 
```

## Usage

This is only a documentation package. You can print out [spec.md](spec.md) to your console:

```sh
$ standard-readme-spec
# Prints out the standard-readme spec
```
